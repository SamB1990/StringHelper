# What is StringHelper

The string helper was born to help me keep a library of useful extensions to strings. I am constantly writing methods across different projects that i again replicate when i move on to the next one so i thought i should create a library.

## Current Functionality
### Wrap
The wrap method takes a string and wraps into an ienumerable of strings each string is wraped to a certain length and will always go back the the last space to ensure that all words are maintined where possible.

### Repeat
Repeats a specified string for a specified amount of times.
